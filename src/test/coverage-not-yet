# This file lists filenames for which we do not currently expect 100%
# coverage. These include files from cpp-common as they're tested
# elsewhere, and some files in Chronos that still need UTs. 
# New files should have 100% code coverage (by lines); it may
# be acceptable to use exclusion markers to achieve this.

# Currently untested Chronos files. These should only be in 
# here temporarily
